Arduino code for an ambient music player.

Design Philosophy
-----------------
  I wanted to create a tabletop music speaker that was sleek, simplistic and
elegant while creating an ambient environment that could relax a user while he
or she worked; while it is aesthetics forward, the visualizer does not
compromise main component functionality.

  There are three buttons on the side of the player — back, pause/play and skip,
respectively. The user interface was designed to be simple, so as not to
distract someone like a phone does. The speakers are placed on two adjacent
sides of the player and the power and microSD adapter on the remaining side.
Everything was hand-soldered onto unlined perfboard. The housing was designed
with the same idea that the player should be minimalistic and sleek.
